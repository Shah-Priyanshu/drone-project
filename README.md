# Drone Project

A collaborative drone development project building a custom WiFi-controlled drone with plans for FPV capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a custom drone system from scratch, starting with basic WiFi control and progressively adding advanced features like camera systems and FPV (First Person View) capabilities.

## Project Phases

We're taking an iterative approach with three main versions:

- **v1:** Basic drone with WiFi control via phone
- **v2:** Camera integration + RF communication types
- **v3:** Proper FPV system with head tracking enhancements

See [versioning.md](versioning.md) for detailed version roadmap.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ESP-IDF installed in WSL (see TODO.md)
- Basic knowledge of electronics and drone mechanics

### Development Environment
- Platform: ESP microcontroller
- IDE: ESP-IDF framework
- Environment: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
