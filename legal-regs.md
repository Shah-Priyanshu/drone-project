### Insurance Requirements (Canada)

**Legal Requirement:** Transport Canada strongly recommends liability insurance but does not explicitly mandate minimum coverage amounts in current regulations. However:

- Canadian Aviation Regulations require operators to be financially prepared for liability
- Many sources cite a **$100,000 minimum liability** requirement for drones over 250g (particularly for commercial operations)
- Commercial clients and landowners often require proof of insurance

**Recommended Coverage:**
- Third-party liability: $500,000 - $5,000,000
- Coverage for bodily injury and property damage
- Personal injury coverage (invasion of privacy claims)
- Hull insurance for drone damage/theft (optional)

**Important:** Standard home insurance policies typically **exclude** aircraft (including drones).
